SharpTox
========

This project aims to provide a simple library that wraps all of the functions found in the [Tox library](https://github.com/irungentoo/ProjectTox-Core "Tox Github repo").
[Tox](https://tox.im "Tox homepage") is a free (as in freedom) Skype replacement.

Note: SharpTox is far from finished/perfect. Feel free to contribute!
