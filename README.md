SharpTox
========

This project aims to provide a simple library that wraps all of the functions found in the [Tox library](https://github.com/irungentoo/ProjectTox-Core "Tox Github repo").
Tox is a free (as in freedom) Skype replacement.

Note: SharpTox is far from finished/perfect. Feel free to contribute!

### Things you'll need

* The libtoxcore library, you can either look for a [pre-compiled one](http://impy.me/u/libtoxcore.dll "A pre-compiled libtoxcore.dll file") online or compile it yourself from the [ProjectTox Github repo](https://github.com/irungentoo/ProjectTox-Core "Tox Github repo").
